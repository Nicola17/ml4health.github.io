### <a id="abstract"></a> ABSTRACT


The goal of the NIPS 2017 Machine Learning for Health Workshop (ML4H) is to foster collaborations that meaningfully impact medicine by bringing together clinicians, health data experts, and machine learning researchers. We aim to build on the success of the last two NIPS ML4H workshops which were widely attended and helped form the foundations of a new research community.
                            
This year’s program emphasizes identifying previously unidentified problems in healthcare that the machine learning community hasn't addressed, or seeing old challenges through a new lens. While healthcare and medicine are often touted as prime examples for disruption by AI and machine learning, there has been vanishingly little evidence of this disruption to date. To interested parties who are outside of the medical establishment (e.g. machine learning researchers), the healthcare system can appear byzantine and impenetrable, which results in a high barrier to entry. In this workshop, we hope to reduce this activation energy by bringing together leaders at the forefront of both machine learning and healthcare for a dialog on areas of medicine that have immediate opportunities for machine learning. Attendees at this workshop will quickly gain an understanding of the key problems that are unique to healthcare and how machine learning can be applied to addressed these challenges.

The workshop will feature invited talks from leading voices in both medicine and machine learning. A key part of our workshop is the clinician pitch; a short presentation of open clinical problems where data-driven solutions can make an immediate difference. This year’s program will also include spotlight presentations and two poster sessions highlighting novel research contributions at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. The workshop will conclude with an interactive a panel discussion where all speakers respond to questions provided by the audience.  


### <a id="submission_instructions"></a> PAPER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS


Researchers interested in contributing should upload an extended abstract of 4 pages in PDF format to EasyChair submission web site:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nips16mlhc
by Monday, October 30, 2017, 11:59pm (time zone of your choice).

Authors should use the [NIPS style file](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/PaperInformation/StyleFiles), and submissions should be suitably anonymized and meet the requirements for double-blind reviewing.

All submissions will be anonymously peer reviewed and will be evaluated on the basis of their technical content. The workshop allows submissions of papers that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal. Authors should state any overlapping published work at time of submission.

### <a id="clinical_pitch_instructions"></a> CLINICAL PITCH SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS


Part of our workshop includes a clinician pitch, a five-minute presentation of open clinical problems that need data-driven solutions. These presentations will be followed by a discussion between invited clinicians and attending ML ­researchers to understand how machine learning can play a role in solving the problem presented. Finally, the pitch plays a secondary role of enabling new collaborations between machine learning researchers and clinicians: an important step for machine learning to have a meaningful role in healthcare. A general call for clinician pitches will be disseminated to clinical researchers and major physician organizations, including clinician social networks such as Doximity.

We will invite submission of two­ page abstracts (not including references) for poster contributions and short oral presentations describing innovative machine learning research on relevant clinical problems and data. Topics of interest include but are not limited to models for diseases and clinical data, temporal models, Markov decision processes for clinical decision support, multi­scale data-­integration, modeling with missing or biased data, learning with non-stationary data, uncertainty and uncertainty propagation, non ­i.i.d. structure in the data, critique of models, causality, model biases, transfer learning, and incorporation of non-clinical (e.g., socioeconomic) factors.
