Proceedings,8,Trust Issues - Uncertainty Estimation Does not Enable Reliable OOD Prediction On Medical Tabular Data,"Dennis Ulmer, Lotta Meijerink, Giovanni Cinà","Pacmed BV, Pacmed BV, Pacmed BV",1,1,Morning,"When deploying machine learning models in high-stakes real-world environments such as health care, it is crucial to accurately assess the uncertainty concerning a model's prediction on abnormal inputs. However, there is a scarcity of literature analyzing this problem on medical data, especially on mixed-type tabular data such as Electronic Health Records. We close this gap by presenting a series of tests including a large variety of contemporary uncertainty estimation techniques, in order to determine whether they are able to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) patients. In contrast to previous work, we design tests on realistic and clinically relevant OOD groups, and run experiments on real-world medical data. We find that almost all techniques fail to achieve convincing results, partly disagreeing with earlier findings.

Proceedings,20,sEMG Gesture Recognition with a Simple Model of Attention,"David Josephs*, Carson Drake*, Andrew Heroy, John Santerre","Southern Methodist University,Southern Methodist University,Southern Methodist University,Southern Methodist University",3,48,Afternoon,"                                 Myoelectric control is one of the leading areas of research in the field of robotic prosthetics. We present our
                                 research in surface electromyography (sEMG) signal classification, where our simple and novel attention-based approach now leads the industry, universally beating more complex, state-of-the-art models. Our novel attention-based model achieves benchmark leading results on multiple industry-standard datasets including 53 finger, wrist, and grasping motions, improving over both sophisticated signal processing and CNN-based approaches. Our strong results with a straightforward model also indicate that sEMG represents a promising avenue for future machine learning research, with applications not only in prosthetics, but also in other important areas, such as diagnosis and prognostication of neurodegenerative diseases, computationally mediated surgeries, and advanced robotic control. We reinforce this suggestion with extensive ablative studies, demonstrating that a neural network can easily extract higher order spatiotemporal features from noisy sEMG data collected by affordable, consumer-grade sensors.

Weiss, Pradeep Ravikumar","Carnegie Mellon University, University of California Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Mellon University",1,2,Morning,"Abbreviation expansion is an important problem in clinical natural language processing because abbreviations often occur in text notes in medical records, and expansions of these abbreviations are critical for downstream applications such as assistive diagnosis and insurance code review. Previous studies have treated abbreviation expansion as a special case of word sense disambiguation; however, abbreviation expansion is easier because we only need the character level expansion and not necessarily the full sense of the abbreviation. In particular, such character level expansions may naturally occur elsewhere in medical contexts. Accordingly, we consider two categories of methods for abbreviation expansion: (a) non-sense-based methods that use information solely at lexical levels using state-of-the-art language models, and (b) sense-based methods that also incorporate sense information, such as glosses, from knowledge bases, to simultaneously perform the two tasks of expansion and disambiguation of the abbreviation. We propose two language model based approaches, including a novel length-agnostic permutation language model, find non-sense methods to be more effective than sense-based methods, and achieve the state-of-the-art on three clinical datasets.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1barZpDcvoIIZCjoGnJL4qETwI3kHIeLI

This is especially true for dermatology, a specialty with thousands of skin conditions but many of which have low prevalence in the real world. Motivated by recent advances, we explore few-shot learning methods as well as conventional class imbalance techniques for the skin condition recognition problem and propose an evaluation setup to fairly assess the real-world utility of such approaches. We find the performance of few-show learning methods does not reach that of conventional class imbalance techniques, but combining the two approaches using a novel ensemble improves model performance, especially for rare classes. We conclude that ensembling can be useful to address the class imbalance problem, yet progress can further be accelerated by real-world evaluation setups for benchmarking new methods.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=16HYN4r-oOj74qV4foOKh_HFSZWJGFZHJ

One of the key elements in ensuring the safe model deployment and building user trust is model explainability. Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) has recently been introduced as a way of providing human-understandable explanations by comparing high-level concepts to the network’s gradients. While the technique has shown promising results in real-world imaging applications, it has not been applied to structured temporal inputs.

While the application of machine learning to EEG recordings has enabled the successful prediction of whether and when such seizures will occur, the reliable detection of epilepsy during seizure-free periods is lacking.

As far as the authors are aware, this work proposes the first deep learning approach for the latter task -- and the second machine learning approach altogether. Additionally, it does so in an interpretable fashion to validate the proposed method for a more wide-spread adoption in healthcare and to potentially unveil unknown epileptic biomarkers. 
The performance of the Tiny Visual Geometry Group (t-VGG) convolutional neural network is evaluated against Temple University Hospital's EEG Epilepsy Corpus, a data set of variable-length EEG recordings gathered during routine checkups.

In this paper, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), one of the most promising state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, is extensively evaluated on histology data by varying a range of different parameters, including training objective, resolution, and data setup. From the results, we are able to draw important conclusions on the usefulness of CPC for digital pathology. We show strong evidence of the limitations of the learned representation for tumor classification, where only low-level information learned early during training, in the first CPC layers, is used. Furthermore, in our experiments, diversifying the distribution of the dataset (i.e., data from multiple organs or medical centers) does not lead to the model learning a more general representation.

To achieve this, we curate a new physiological dataset by merging the publicly available bioVid pain and emotion datasets. We then investigate pain level recognition on this dataset simulating participants' naturalistic affective behaviors. Our findings demonstrate that acknowledging affect in pain assessment is essential. We observe degradation in recognition performance when simulating the existence of affect to validate pain assessment models that do not account for it. Conversely, we observe a performance boost in recognition when we account for affect.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JbiCTCEdnOYdqrq376IVHHThjYTroria

Whereas most machine learning algorithms learn from fixed length or regularly-collected panel data, health records data are neither.  To facilitate the development of transparent and reproducible machine learning models from such data, we introduce TL-Lite, a clinical data ingestion, transformation, and visualization tool for conducting temporal machine learning.  The central principle behind TL-Lite is to provide visual responsiveness at the individual level alongside management of the desired transformations behind the scenes that go on to be applied throughout the cohort and that result in cohort-level summaries, statistics, models and predictions.  Characterization of the tool, discussion of design choices, and examples of use demonstrate its added value. A demo is provided at https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jweiss2/viz.html.

An appealing approach to scaled deployment is to leverage the ubiquity of smartphones by capturing photos of x-rays to share with clinicians using messaging services like WhatsApp. However, the application of chest x-ray algorithms to photos of chest x-rays requires reliable classification in the presence of artifacts not typically encountered on digital x-rays used to train machine learning models. We introduce CheXphoto, a dataset of smartphone photos and synthetic photographic transformations of chest x-rays sampled from the CheXpert dataset. To generate CheXphoto we (1) automatically and manually captured photos of digital x-rays under different settings, and (2) generated synthetic transformations of digital x-rays targeted to make them look like photos of digital x-rays and x-ray films. We release this dataset as a resource for testing and improving the robustness of deep learning algorithms for automated chest x-ray interpretation on smartphone photos of chest x-rays.

Proceedings,219,Spectral discontinuity design: Interrupted time series with spectral mixture kernels,David Leeftink; Max Hinne,"Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour",2,26,Morning,"Quasi-experimental designs allow researchers to determine the effect of a treatment, even when randomized controlled trials are infeasible. A prominent example is interrupted time series (ITS) design, in which the effect of an intervention is determined by comparing the extrapolation of a model trained on data acquired up to moment of intervention, with the interpolation by a model trained on data up to the intervention. Typical approaches for ITS use (segmented) linear regression, and consequently ignore many of the spectral features of time series data. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to ITS, that uses Gaussian process regression and the spectral mixture kernel. This approach can capture more structure of the time series than traditional methods like linear regression or AR(I)MA models, which improves the extrapolation performance, and hence the accuracy of causal inference. We demonstrate our approach in simulations, and use it to determine the causal effect of Kundalini yoga meditation on heart rate oscillations.

To drastically reduce such cost, responders to an oncology treatment need to be identified early on in the drug development process with limited amount of patient data before the planning of Phase 3 clinical trials. Despite the challenge of small sample size, we pioneered the use of deep-learning derived digital pathology scores to identify responders based on the immunohistochemistry images of the target antigen expressed in tumor biopsy samples from a Phase 1 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer clinical trial. Based on repeated 10-fold cross validations, the deep-learning derived score on average achieved 4% higher AUC of ROC curve and 6% higher AUC of Precision-Recall curve comparing to the tumor proportion score (TPS) based clinical benchmark.  In a small independent testing set of patients, we also demonstrated that the deep-learning derived score achieved numerically at least 25% higher responder rate in the enriched population than the TPS clinical benchmark.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=15hpIl5qNzCNqow8G0Y5pF3YHaxvnEESy

The state of the art therefore relies on strongly-supervised model training using additional local annotations from domain experts. However, in the absence of detailed annotations, most weakly-supervised approaches depend on a frozen feature extractor pre-trained on ImageNet. We identify this as a key weakness and propose to train an in-domain feature extractor on histology images using MoCo v2, a recent self-supervised learning algorithm. Experimental results on Camelyon16 and TCGA show that the proposed extractor greatly outperforms its ImageNet counterpart. In particular, our results improve the weakly-supervised state of the art on Camelyon16 from 91.4% to 98.7% AUC, thereby closing the gap with strongly-supervised models that reach 99.3% AUC. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that feature extractors trained via self-supervised learning can act as drop-in replacements to significantly improve existing machine learning techniques in histology.

Given fMRI data, the problem of inferring the task, known as task state decoding, is challenging due to the high dimensionality (hundreds of million sampling points per datum) and complex spatio-temporal blood flow patterns inherent in the data. In this work, we propose to tackle the fMRI task state decoding problem by casting it as a 4D spatio-temporal classification problem. We present a novel architecture called Brain Attend and Decode (BAnD), that uses residual convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms for temporal modeling. We achieve significant performance gain compared to previous works on a 7-task benchmark from the large-scale Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA) dataset. We also investigate the transferability of BAnD's extracted features on unseen HCP tasks, either by freezing the spatial feature extraction layers and retraining the temporal model, or finetuning the entire model. The pre-trained features from BAnD are useful on similar tasks while finetuning them yields competitive results on unseen tasks/conditions.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bg602Izf-WJhytNUalCZj4SfXZO3K-j3

In this paper, we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them.

Proceedings,506,Quantifying Common Support between Multiple Treatment Groups Using a Contrastive VAE,"Wangzhi Dai, Collin M. Stultz","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital ",4,76,Afternoon,"Estimating the effect of a given medical treatment on individual patients involves evaluating how clinical outcomes are affected by the treatment in question. Robust estimates of the treatment effect for a given patient with a pre-specified set of clinical characteristics, are possible to obtain when there is sufficient common support for these features. Essentially, features having the greatest common support correspond to regions of significant overlap between the distributions of the different treatment groups.  In observational datasets, however, all possible treatment options may not be uniformly represented, and therefore robust estimation of their effect may only be possible for the patients in the overlapping region.  In this work, we propose a Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (Contrastive-VAE) to estimate where there is significant overlap between patient distributions corresponding to different treatment options. A Contrastive-VAE exploits shared information between different groups by modeling the shared information as arising from a shared set of latent variables to approximate distributions for treatment options that are not well represented in observational datasets. The result is an improved estimation of the distribution of the groups with a small number of data points. By estimating the likelihood for each group with annealed importance sampling, we are able to quantitatively identify the area of overlap between multiple treatment groups and obtain an effective confidence interval for the estimated individual treatment effect.",5:15 - 6:15 pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Qrd_fUOGqj908gF-ZvE0oj9svgK1jG4s

Due to the seriousness of this condition many normal infants and those with benign head shape abnormalities are referred to pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeons, leading to a high referral burden and delays in diagnosis for patients. A diagnostic delay beyond 4 months of age excludes patients from being treated with minimally invasive endoscopic procedures, leading to higher risk open surgeries. Machine learning (ML) image classifiers can enhance the triaging process of these referrals through the use of 3D images taken by a multi-camera & angle setup during patient visits. In doing so, children with synostosis can be identified earlier, qualifying them for less invasive endoscopic surgical intervention. After training a variety of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on 3D images supplemented with synthetic images using generative adversarial networks (GANs), the best-performing model was found to be a novel approach developed in our study called a multi-view collapsed 3D CNN, which achieved area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC) between 90.00-97.00% for detecting various sub-types of synostosis. These results demonstrate the ability for ML models to potentially streamline the detection of children with synostosis and help overcome challenges associated with high referral burdens for these patients.
