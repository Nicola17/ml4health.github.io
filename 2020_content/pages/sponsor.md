We are grateful to Roche for the support for this year's 2020 ML4H workshop.

Roche has been committed to improving lives since the company was founded in 1896 in Basel, Switzerland. Today, Roche creates innovative medicines and diagnostic tests that help millions of patients globally.


Roche is a leader in research-focused healthcare with combined strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Roche is the world’s largest biotech company, with truly differentiated medicines in oncology, immunology, infectious diseases, ophthalmology and neuroscience.


Personalised Healthcare and its impact on people’s lives will only become a reality, if all stakeholders work together. Roche is engaging in partnerships to leverage the power of real world data and  artificial intelligence that can answer some of the most important questions in science and healthcare. 


At the same time, it is our unshakeable commitment to be a trusted partner for patients and society by fulfilling the highest standards in terms of protecting the privacy of data shared by patients. For us this is not just an opportunity, it’s an obligation to get this right.
