<h3><a id="corrado"></a> Greg Corrado</h3>
<p>Greg Corrado, PhD - Greg Corrado is a senior research scientist at Google interested in biological neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and scalable machine learning. He has published in fields ranging across behavioral economics, neuromorphic device physics, systems neuroscience, and deep learning. At Google he has worked for some time on brain inspired computing, and most recently has served as one of the founding members and the co-technical lead of Google's large scale deep neural networks project.

<h3><a id="kohane"></a> Isaac (Zak) Kohane</h3>
<p>Isaac Kohane, MD/PhD - Isaac Kohane is the inaugural chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. Over the last 30 years, his research agenda has been driven by the vision of what biomedical researchers could do to find new cures, provide new diagnoses and deliver the best care available if data could be converted more rapidly to knowledge and knowledge to practice. In so doing, Kohane has designed and led multiple internationally adopted efforts to “instrument” the healthcare enterprise for discovery and to enable innovative decision-making tools to be applied to the point of care. At the same time, the new insights afforded by ’omic-scale molecular analyses have inspired him and his collaborators to work on re-characterizing and re-classifying diseases such as autism, rheumatoid arthritis and cancers. In many of these studies, the developmental trajectories of thousands of genes have been a powerful tool in unraveling complex diseases.

<h3><a id="mesirov"></a> Jill Mesirov</h3>
<p>Jill Mesirov, PhD, has joined UC San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center as associate vice chancellor for computational health sciences and professor of medicine. Mesirov most recently served as associate director and chief informatics officer at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where she directed the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program. As associate vice chancellor, Mesirov will help formulate an overarching strategy for computational health sciences and research computing at UC San Diego School of Medicine. Mesirov’s research focuses on applying machine-learning methods to functional genomics data in two main areas: cancer and infectious disease. In cancer, Mesirov’s team is analyzing molecular data to determine the underlying biological mechanisms of specific tumor subtypes and to stratify patients according to their relative risks of relapse. In infectious disease, the team is using functional data to better understand the host-pathogen relationship in malaria, as well as to identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis of viral and bacterial diseases and biomarkers of vaccine efficacy.</p>
<h3><a id="murphy"></a> Susan Murphy</h3>
<p>Susan Murphy is a statistician developing new methodologies to evaluate courses of treatment for individuals coping with chronic or relapsing disorders such as depression or substance abuse. In contrast to the treatment of acute illness, where clinicians make a single decision about treatment, doctors treating chronic ailments make a sequence of decisions over time about the best therapeutic approach based on the current state of a patient, the stage of the disease, and the individual’s response to prior treatments. Prof. Murphy has developed a formal model of this decision-making process and an innovative design for clinical trials that allow researchers to test the efficacy of adaptive interventions. While the standard clinical trial paradigm simply tests and compares “one shot” treatments in a defined population, Murphy’s Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) is a means for learning how best to dynamically adapt treatment to each individual’s response over time.</p>
<h3><a id="van_der_schaar"></a> Mihaela van der Schaar</h3>
<p>Mihaela van der Schaar is Man Professor of Quantitative Finance in the Oxford – Man Institute of Quantitative Finance (OMI) and the Department of Engineering Science at Oxford, Fellow of Christ Church College and Faculty Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute, London. Mihaela's research interests and expertise are in machine learning, data science and decisions for a better planet. In particular, she is interested in developing machine learning and decision theory for finance, medicine and personalized education. She also has research interests and expertise in game theory and applications, and in social, economic and biological networks. She leads the Data Science and Decisions Research Group.</p>
<h3><a id="suleyman"></a> Mustafa Suleyman</h3>
<p>Mustafa Suleyman is co-founder and Head of Applied AI at DeepMind, where he is responsible for the application of DeepMind’s technology to real-world problems, as part of DeepMind’s commitment to use intelligence to make the world a better place. In February 2016 he launched DeepMind Health, which builds clinician-led technology in the NHS. Mustafa was Chief Product Officer before DeepMind was bought in 2014 by Google in their largest European acquisition to date. At 19, Mustafa dropped out of Oxford University to help set up a telephone counselling service, building it to become one of the largest mental health support services of its kind in the UK, and then worked as policy officer for then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. He went on to help start Reos Partners, a consultancy with seven offices across four continents specializing in designing and facilitating large-scale multi-stakeholder ‘Change Labs’ aimed at navigating complex problems. As a skilled negotiator and facilitator Mustafa has worked across the world for a wide range of clients such as the UN, the Dutch Government and WWF.</p>

### <a id="vemuri"></a> Prashanthi Vemuri

The research of Prashanthi Vemuri, Ph.D., is geared toward developing and validating imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, tracking disease progression and answering key mechanistic questions related to neurodegenerative diseases and dementias using multimodal imaging. She develops technology based on MRI and PET scans. A major problem with the current clinical diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease is that once patients begin to show symptoms, substantial brain damage has already occurred. From a public health perspective, diagnostic instruments for early diagnosis are urgently needed. Dr. Vemuri's research contributes to the development of such instruments. Pitch topic: Clinical problems in aging and dementia where machine learning can be applied to make a difference.
