TODO FILL TEXT

Researchers interested in contributing should upload short, anonymized papers of up to 4 pages in PDF format by TODO in the timezone of your choice.

Please submit via our ML4H EasyChair website: TODO

Papers should adhere to the NIPS conference paper format, 
via the NIPS LaTeX style file:
[https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles).

Workshop papers should be at most 4 pages of content, including text and figures. Additional pages containing only bibliographic references can be included without penalty.

Authors will not be penalized for including an appendix of supplementary material after the references. However, reviewers will not be required to consult any appendices to make their decisions. The main 4-page paper should adequately describe the work and its contributions.

#### Relevant Topics

Submitted papers should describe innovative machine learning research focused on relevant problems in health and medicine. 
This can mean new models, new datasets, new algorithms, or new applications.
Topics of interest include but are not limited to reinforcement learning, temporal models, deep learning, semi-supervised learning, data integration, learning from missing or biased data, learning from non-stationary data, model criticism, model interpretability, causality, model biases, and transfer learning.

#### Peer Review and Acceptance Criteria

All submissions will undergo double-blind peer review. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper. Do not include any names or affiliations. Refer to your own past work in the third-person.

Accepted papers will be chosen based on technical merit and suitability to the workshop's goals. All accepted papers will be included in one of two poster presentation sessions on the day of the workshop. Some accepted papers will be invited to give short oral spotlight presentations at the workshop.

#### Registration and Attendance

To promote community interaction, we hope at least one presenting author
has registered and can attend the workshop. However, because NIPS workshop
registration has sold out, we encourage all researchers to submit a paper
regardless of their registration status.

Accepted papers that cannot attend will at least be listed on our website.
It is unlikely that we will be able to create new registration spots for
accepted papers, but we are exploring possibilities. If your paper is
accepted and you cannot attend due to registration or other issues, please
contact us after you are accepted and we'll find solutions on a
case-by-case basis. Acceptance notifications will go out a few days before
the NIPS deadline for full refunds.

#### Copyright for Accepted Papers

This workshop will be informally published online but not officially archived. This means:

* **Authors will retain full copyright** of their papers.

* Acceptance to NIPS ML4H 2018 does not preclude publication of the same material in another journal or conference.

We encourage (but do not require) accepted papers to be posted on arXiv. With author permission, we will post links to accepted short papers on our workshop website.

Our workshop does allow submission of papers that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal. Authors should clearly state any overlapping published work at time of submission.
